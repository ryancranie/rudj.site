title: Bumped into you

GCU, freshers, I'm hanging, chilling, wearing the grey hat I just bought. 

You're on the way in Yasi, I'm at the uni, and I'm serious I was thinking about you, the chances you're coming to GCU from college, then I spot you from a mile away, shocked to find out your hair isnot actually blue.

I just had a feeling I'd see you.
