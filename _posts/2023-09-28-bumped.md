GCU, freshers, I'm hanging, chilling, wearing the grey hat I just bought, I'd end up wearing this hundreds of times.

You're on the way in Yasi, I'm at the uni, of course I was thinking about you. The chances you're coming to GCU from college like me. And I was right.

I spot you from a mile away, so shocked to find out your hair is not actually blue. I just had a feeling I'd see you at that freshers again.

I messaged you later, ...
