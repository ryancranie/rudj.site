8 Ball! Pool! Wow, an amazing idea! A cheap, loving bar at cheerful prices. We invited everyone, but you and I <b>both know</b> we wanted to see each other the most.

Prior to pool, you'd sent me your music stuff, I kept listening to it on repeat, Nightride stuck with me the most. A few hours before pool, I cried to Nightride, Because I finally told myself I was in love with you.

We're at pool now, you look cute, we walked in with Nathan, patched by the other one. It was great! We hung out super well, you harmonizing as my company again as we did in the bootcamp.

Here's a little secret... I know I've told you this but not to the true extent. I <b>barely</b> had played pool prior to us meeting, and I got coached by my grandad a few days prior, so I could impress you. Mwehehehe

That is true, and it paid off. I impressed you. Your jaw dropped when I hit that red ball in the corner pocket, I got a little excited tbh, it was nice to impress you like that.

Some time later, it's just us 2. You convince me to try jagerbombs? So funny and random in retrospect. That spoons was pissing busy, but all I could hear was you. I was locked in, warm jager down my throat.

It's late, and here comes the funny part, the super funny part. We are drunk, we're at the bus station, laughing. I noticed something, a crum under your eye. It was Awfully bold of you to tell me to "get it." I seized the oppourtunity, and sneakily (kind of) brushed your cold cheek after.

Then it just came out, I told you how I felt. You told me, my feelings were requited. I was in disbelief. You can call me a mastermind all you want, but it was a bluff. I mean, I didn't do it on purpose, I must be just naturely so handsome and attractive to you.

What a night, Hannah picked you up, and you got home safe.
