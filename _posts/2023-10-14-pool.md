8 Ball! Pool! Wow an amazing idea, cheap, loving bar at cheerful prices. We invited everyone, but I know you and I <b>both know</b> we just wanted to see each other the most.

Yea you looked cute, we walked in with Nathan, patched by the other one. It was great! We hung out super well, you harmonizing as my company again as we did in the bootcamp.

Here's a little secret... I know I've told you this but not to the true extent. I <b>barely</b> had played pool prior to us meeting, and I got coached by my grandad a few days prior, so I could impress you. 

It's true, and I impressed you. Your jaw dropped when I hit that red ball in the corner pocket. I got a little excited tbh, it was nice to impress you.

Some time later, it's just us 2. You convince me to try jagerbombs? So random in retrospect, but I remember it. That spoons was pissing busy, but all I could hear was you. I was locked in, warm jager down my throat.

It's late, and here's the funny part, super funny. We are drunk, we're at the bus station, laughing. I noticed something, a crum under your eye. It was Awfully bold of you to tell me to "get it." I seized the oppourtunity, and stroked your cheek after.

It slipped out, I told you how I felt, you told me. I was in disbelief. You can call me a mastermind all you want, but it was a bluff. I mean, I didn't do it on purpose, I must be just naturely so handsome to you.

What a night, Hannah picked you up, and you got home safe.
